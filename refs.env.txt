# BWA_REF: path to BWA index files generated using bwa index (this should include the file prefixes, such as: path/to/index/my_prefix)
# CHROMS: path to a file containing the organism's chromosomes (including unplaced scaffolds)
# INTERVAL_ARRAY: path to a directory containing multiple interval files (for parallel jobs)
# INTERVAL_FILE: path to a file containing all chromosome intervals (should be .list, .intervals, or .interval_list)
# PROBE: path to probe file (likely a .interval file included with probe-capture kit)
# REF: path to reference genome fasta file
# SAMPLE_KEY: path to a CSV key with sample names and the corresponding microchip IDs
# TARGET: path to target list (likely a .interval file included with probe-capture kit)
